# Facial-expression-detection-using-Keras

This is code from coursera project work i have done. This is about Facial emotion recognition using Deep Learning. The model is trained by 4 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers and then by the Final output layer. The model weights are stored in model_weights.h5. Opensource code is used to crate a flask app which is run on a basic HTML code which projects the final video. Change the the code line in Camera.py if you want to use a webcamera to input video. change the location of video to " 0 " to access webcam.
model uses tensorflow,keras,opencv to run the model
