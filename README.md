# Facial-expression-detection-using-Keras

This is code from coursera project work i have done. This is about Facial emotion recognition using Deep Learning. The model is trained by 4 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers and then by the Final output layer. The model weights are stored in model_weights.h5. Opensource code is used to crate a flask app which is run on a basic HTML code which projects the final video. Change the the code line in Camera.py if you want to use a webcamera to input video. change the location of video to " 0 " to access webcam.
model uses tensorflow,keras,opencv to run the model

# Problem Statement
To identify Facial expressions using Deep neural networks (Convolutional Neural Networks).

# Data Source
The dataset is used from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)
The code used is from the coursera's project based learning course primarily taught by Snehan Kekre (https://www.coursera.org/learn/facial-expression-recognition-keras/home/info)

# Approach
The model is trained by 4 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers and then by the Final output layer. The model weights are stored in model_weights.h5. Opensource code is used to crate a flask app which is run on a basic HTML code which projects the final video. Model uses seaborn,matplotlib,numpy,tensorflow and keras for initial training. Opencv is used for face detection and Flask is used to create HTML GUI. 

# Industry Relevance
1. Customer Service
The technology can also be used by those within the hospitality industry to deliver a greater level of customer service. For example, facial recognition can allow employees to quickly identify guests satisfaction and sentiments, perhaps before they even check-in, and deliver more personalised greetings and a more tailored service.

4. Research and Information
In order to understand customers, improve services and optimise processes, hotels and other companies need to be able to gather feedback and data. Sentiment analysis can be done through emotion detection.
